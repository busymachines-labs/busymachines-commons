### History

This used to be the resting place of the `busymachines-commons` library that we used internally for various projects, it reached version `0.6.5`, but it fell into disrepair. If you require that library, by any chance, then check-out the `zz_deprecated/release-0.6.5` branch, and good luck from there. That bit will never be maintained again. And what you find resembles what was only by accident.
